<h2>100 Pair outside Telco</h2>
This lab was designed to provide the experience of Terminating Telco outside plant cable. This type of cable is used in the outside plant application to carry telephone circuits from the CO to the local customer. In this excercise the 100-Pair cable is used to simulate outside plant cabling being terminated at the Main Telco Room in a building. the 100 pairs are Terminated on a 110 block, which represents the entrance point to the building.

NOTE: This was Actually a very tricky lab with the color striping on the 'inside plant' 25-pair gray jacketed cable. The 'outside' plant cable only has one color on each wire.
