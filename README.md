<h2>Termination of 100-pair Cable</h2>
This lab was designed to provide the experience of Terminating Telco outside plant cable. This type of cable is used in the outside plant application to carry telephone circuits from the CO to the local customer. In this excercise the 100-Pair cable is used to simulate outside plant cabling being terminated at the Main Telco Room in a building. the 100 pairs are Terminated on a 110 block, which represents the entrance point to the building.

NOTE: This was Actually a very tricky lab with the color striping on the 'inside plant' 25-pair gray jacketed cable. The 'outside' plant cable only has one color on each wire.

<br /> 

<h2>Supplies Needed</h2>
- <b>Large Cable Cutter</b> 
- <b>Safety Goggles</b>
- <b>Electricians Scissors</b> 
- <b>Rotary Cable Slitter</b>

<h2>Tools used</h2>
- <b>100 Pair Cabling</b> 
- <b>110 Punchdown Blade</b>

<h2>Cross-Connect 110 Block to 66 Block</h2>
This purpose of this lab was to learn to cross-connect from a 66 Block to a 110 Block. This type of connection is the industry standard method of cross connecting or programming voice and telephone circuits within most commercial installations.

<br />
<br />

<h2>Three Key Methods Learned</h2>
<br />

- <b>Punching down to 110 --></b> 
- <b>Loop Through without cutting --></b>
- <b>Terminating the cross connect on the final block</b>

<br /> 

<h2>Supplies Needed</h2>
- <b>Spool of Cross Connect Wire</b>
- <b>Cable Ties</b>

<h2>Tools used</h2>
- <b>Safety Goggles</b> 
- <b>Impact Punchdown Tool</b>
- <b>66 and 110 Punchdown Blades</b>
- <b>Wire Probe</b>
